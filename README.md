#### **Introduction**
This project utilizes deep learning to classify chest X-ray images into four categories: Pneumonia, COVID-19, Tuberculosis, and Normal. By employing the ResNet50 convolutional neural network architecture, the model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging through advanced feature extraction and classification techniques.

#### **SMART Questions**
1. How effectively can ResNet50 classify X-ray images into distinct disease categories?
2. Does balancing the dataset improve classification accuracy for underrepresented classes?
3. How does the model‚Äôs performance change with the inclusion of BatchNormalization and Dropout layers?
4. What metrics best represent the success of the classification model (e.g., accuracy, loss)?
5. Can the model achieve a high generalization capability across diverse datasets?
